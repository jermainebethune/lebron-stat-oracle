```
"When did he score 40+ against Boston?"
→ SELECT date, opponent, points FROM games WHERE opponent = 'BOS' AND points >= 40
→ 9 rows from D1
→ "He scored 40 or more against Boston on 2006-02-15, 2008-05-18, 2010-04-04, …"
```

Built on Cloudflare Workers, Workers AI, and D1. Runs on the free tier.

## The idea

A chatbot asked "how many points does LeBron have?" answers from training data, and can be
confidently wrong. This never asks the model what it knows.

The model has exactly two jobs:

1. Turn a question into a SQL query
2. Describe rows that were handed to it

Every number a user sees came out of the database in between. The model cannot invent a
statistic because it is never asked to recall one.

```
question → Worker → authorize → Workers AI (writes SQL) → guard → D1 (runs it)
                    (Turnstile                                      ↓
                     or API key)                                  real rows
                                                                    ↓
        answer ← Workers AI (describes rows) ←──────────────────────┘
```

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler login

npm run schema     # create tables in D1
npm run seed       # load data
npm run deploy

npm test           # guard unit tests
```

To regenerate the dataset you need a [balldontlie](https://balldontlie.io) API key with
stats access in `~/.balldontlie_key`:

```bash
node extract.mjs > seed.sql && npm run seed
```

The key is only used by the extractor. The deployed Worker reads D1 and nothing else, so
there is no secret in production.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/index.js` | Request flow and error handling |
| `src/access.js` | Who may spend a Neuron — Turnstile or API key |
| `src/guard.js` | SQL validation — the security boundary |
| `src/prompts.js` | The two prompts and the schema shown to the model |
| `src/ui.js` | Single-page frontend — design, chalk-burst canvas, Turnstile wiring |
| `public/img/` | Photographs, served by the static assets binding |
| `extract.mjs` | Regenerates `seed.sql` from the balldontlie API |
| `deploy.sh` | Deploys, then emails a summary — only if the deploy succeeded |
| `test/guard.test.js` | 15 unit tests against the guard |
| `eval/cases.js` | The answer key — 20 questions with queries we trust |
| `eval/run.mjs` | Runs the answer key against the live app |

## Evaluating the SQL layer

Every bug below was a SQL-generation error, and every one was found by hand, one at a time.
That is not a strategy. `npm run eval` is the systematic version.

Each case pairs a question in English with **a query we wrote ourselves and trust**. The
runner executes both and compares the *results* — not the SQL text, because there are many
correct ways to write the same query and string-matching would fail on harmless rewording
while passing subtly wrong logic.

```
$ npm run eval

  opponent-not-team         ✓ 9 rows
  truncation-disclosed      ✓ capped at 100, disclosed
  awards-refused            ✓ refused
  ...
  20/20 passed (100%)
```

Expected values are never hard-coded — they come from running the trusted query against the
live database, so reloading the dataset moves the expectations with it and fixtures cannot go
stale. Failures print both queries side by side.

Every shipped bug is a case tagged `regression`, so none of them can come back silently.
`npm run eval -- --regression` runs just those.

**A full run is ~710 Neurons, about 7% of the daily free allowance** — roughly 14 runs a day.
Run it when something changes, not on every save.

### What it immediately paid for

**It found bug 10 on its first run.** "40+ games" has 108 results; the guard's `LIMIT 100`
truncated it to 100 and the app presented that as the complete answer. Nobody would have
noticed. Results that hit the cap now say so.

**It settled the model question with a number.** The SQL model is 94% of the running cost,
and swapping it for the cheap one was previously a leap of faith. Measured:

| SQL model | Neurons/call | Eval score |
|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5-coder-32b` | 33.2 | **20/20 (100%)** |
| `llama-3.2-3b` | 2.3 | 14/20 (70%) |

The cheap model is 14× cheaper and fails six cases — including three refusals. It answered
"how many championships?" with `SELECT COUNT(opponent) FROM games WHERE playoff = 1`, which
returns a real number that is not remotely the answer. That is the MVP bug all over again.

**14× cheaper is not worth 30% wrong.** But that is now a decision backed by a measurement
rather than an instinct, and re-running the comparison after any prompt change takes one
command.

## Who can spend a Neuron

`/api/ask` was originally open to anyone who knew the URL. At ~35.5 Neurons per question
against a 10,000/day allowance, a trivial loop could exhaust the daily budget in minutes and
take the app down until 00:00 UTC.

Two ways in now, checked **before any inference runs**:

- **A Turnstile token** — what the page sends. Cloudflare's CAPTCHA alternative; usually
  invisible, occasionally a one-click checkbox for traffic that looks automated. Tokens are
  single-use, so the widget is reset after every question.
- **An `x-api-key` header** — so the thing stays drivable programmatically, for testing and
  for anyone handed a key.

Both secrets live as Worker secrets (`wrangler secret put`), never in the repo. The check
fails closed: if a secret isn't configured, that path is simply unavailable rather than
silently open.

```bash
curl -X POST https://chalk-toss.jermaine-e7a.workers.dev/api/ask \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'x-api-key: <key>' \
  -d '{"question":"What was his career high?"}'
```

Worth naming the mistake this fixed: the SQL guard was built carefully against an
interesting threat — a model writing dangerous queries — while an ordinary one went
unconsidered for the whole build. Anyone could just call it. Hardening the interesting
attack surface is not the same as hardening the whole thing.

## The guard

An LLM writing SQL against your database is a real risk. The guard is an **allowlist with a
preprocessing pass**, not a keyword blocklist, because a blocklist is trivially defeated:

```sql
SELECT 1 /* comment */ ; DROP TABLE games
```

Scanning for `DROP` first sees a comment hiding a semicolon. So the order matters:

1. Strip comments and string literals, so nothing can hide syntax
2. Assert what remains is a single `SELECT` or `WITH`
3. Only then scan for forbidden constructs
4. Inject our own `LIMIT`, and cap any the model supplied

Blanking literals first also avoids false positives — `WHERE note = 'Roster update'` is data,
not a verb, and still works.

The D1 binding should also be read-only in production. The guard is defence in depth, not
the only defence.

## What went wrong while building it

The architecture worked immediately. Everything below was found by running it, and each one
is a more useful lesson than the parts that worked.

**1. The model catalog disagreed with the runtime.** The first model choice returned
"deprecated" at runtime while the account's own model-search API still listed it as
available with no deprecation flag — and listed a second dead model too. Fixed by
test-running six candidates against the live runtime before committing. Don't trust a
catalog you can probe.

**2. Ambiguous schema comments produced wrong SQL.** "40+ against Boston" became
`team = 'BOS'`, but `team` is *his* team. Zero rows. Fixed in the schema comments — and
notably, this model follows schema comments far more reliably than rules in the system
prompt. A later fix that was ignored as a prompt rule worked immediately when moved into a
schema comment.

**3. Right numbers, wrong question.** "How many games in Miami?" produced
`COUNT(*) FROM seasons` = 2, and the summary read "He played 2 games in Miami." Every number
was real; the sentence was still wrong. Fixed by documenting in the schema that `games` is a
curated sample and counts must come from `seasons.games`.

**4. The summarizer contradicted the database.** About one run in three it reported "no
matching games" while D1 had returned rows. The cause was a prompt instruction — "if the rows
are empty, say so" — that a small model fired regardless of the rows. **Fixed by deciding the
empty case in code, before the model is called at all.** A branch the code can evaluate
should never be delegated to a model. It also saves an inference call.

**5. An empty column answered a question it shouldn't have.** "How many MVPs did he win?"
returned **0**. The dataset has no awards data, so `accolades` was NULL on every row. The
column had already been removed from the model's schema prompt, but the model invented a
query against it anyway, the column still physically existed, and the query *succeeded*.

This is the one worth internalizing:

> Grounding a model in a datastore prevents **invented** numbers. It does not prevent a
> **wrong query** from producing a confidently wrong answer. An empty column is more
> dangerous than a missing one, because an empty column answers.

Fixed by dropping the column and catching D1 errors, so a query against absent data reads as
"not in this database" rather than as a number.

**6. Off-by-one in an inclusive range.** "40+" generated `points > 40`, silently excluding
19 exactly-40-point games. Caught by checking a boundary case rather than trusting an answer
that looked right.

**7. A partial table answered questions it couldn't actually answer.** `games` began as 238
rows curated by *scoring* thresholds. Asked "what game did he have the most blocks?", the app
correctly refused — blocks weren't stored at all. But simply adding the column would have
produced something worse than a refusal: his three 5-block games were **21, 17 and 15-point
nights**, none of which met the scoring criteria, so the query would have returned a 4-block
game and presented it as a career high. Every number real, the answer wrong.

Fixed by loading **all 1,912 games** and the full stat line. ~1,900 rows is nothing for D1,
and the curation was buying tidiness at the cost of correctness.

> A sample can only answer questions about the axis you sampled on.

**8. `LIMIT 1` hides ties.** "Highest blocks" returned one game when three share the record —
and no prompt rule could fix it, because the SQL truncated the tie before the model ever saw
it. Superlatives now use `WHERE x = (SELECT MAX(x) ...)` so ties surface as ties.

**9. "Minutes in his career high game" ordered by minutes.** It returned his longest game (54
minutes) rather than the minutes in his 61-point game (41). Fixed by pinning "career high" to
points in the prompt — *order by the stat named, not the stat asked for*.

**10. The row cap silently truncated results.** Found by the eval harness on its first full
run, which is the entire argument for having one. "40+ games" returns 108 rows; the guard
injects `LIMIT 100`; the app returned 100 and described them as if that were all of them.
Every number real, the answer incomplete, and no way for a reader to tell. Capped results now
say so explicitly.

> A truncated answer presented as complete is the same failure as a wrong number.

## The front end

Named for the pre-game ritual, and the design follows from it: arena-dark ground, chalk-white
type, and a puff of chalk thrown from the Ask button when a question goes up. That burst is the
only motion on the page and fires on submit only, so it marks a moment rather than decorating
one. It respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Accent colour is Heat red because both photographs are from the Miami years — **if the photos
are ever swapped for Cleveland or Lakers shots, the accent has to move with them.**

Two things worth knowing if you edit it:

- **The hero is full-height, so anything written into the results container starts below the
  fold.** Every output state routes through one `render()` helper that writes *and* scrolls.
  Originally only the success path scrolled, which made errors and the "verification still
  clearing" message look like the page had done nothing at all.
- **Scroll to the first result slab, not the container** — the container carries large vertical
  padding, so targeting it lands the viewport in a blank gap.

## Deploy notifications

`npm run deploy` deploys and then emails a summary. Cloudflare has **no "Worker deployed"
alert type** — the only Workers alert is log-based observability, which fires on errors, not
deployments. Workers Builds would provide one, but only if you deploy through Cloudflare's CI
rather than from a laptop. So `deploy.sh` sends the mail itself, via the `hey` CLI.

The email carries the commit, version ID, and a **live health check of the thing just
shipped** — so it reports reality rather than merely that `wrangler` exited 0.

Two things this got wrong first time, both worth knowing:

- **The first version emailed on a failed deploy.** It piped `wrangler` into `tee` and chained
  the notifier with `&&` — but a pipeline's exit status is the *last* command's, so `tee`
  succeeding masked `wrangler` failing. Now the status is captured with `PIPESTATUS`.
- It only fires for `npm run deploy`. A bare `wrangler deploy` skips it.

## Photographs — attribution still needed

The two photos in `public/img/` are from Wikimedia Commons (filenames matched the Commons
naming convention), resized and re-compressed from ~900 KB down to 220 KB total.

**Most LeBron photographs on Commons are CC BY-SA, which requires naming the photographer,
linking the licence, and noting that the image was modified.** These are cropped and resized,
so that last part applies. The site footer currently carries a placeholder credit; it needs
the real photographer and licence before this counts as properly attributed.

To fix: find each file's page on Wikimedia Commons, take the author and licence, and replace
the `#photo-credit` line in `src/ui.js`.

## Limits worth stating

- **`games` holds every game** — 1,912 rows, regular season and playoffs, with minutes,
  points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and turnovers. It was once a 238-game sample
  curated by scoring thresholds; see bug 7 below for why that had to change.
- **`seasons.games` is the regular-season total** (1,565). `games` includes the 293 playoff
  appearances, so the two counts differ on purpose.
- **No awards, salary, or biographical data.** Those questions are refused rather than
  guessed. Deliberately left absent instead of hand-entered.
- **The guard has never fired in production.** Injection attempts are refused by the model at
  the prompt layer first. Those tests prove the *prompt* held, not the validator — the guard
  exists for the day the prompt doesn't, and is proven by the unit tests.
- **The custom domain sits behind the zone's bot protection**, which challenges non-browser
  clients. The `workers.dev` URL is kept live as the unchallenged path for API use.

## Cost

Everything fits the Cloudflare free tier: 100k Worker requests/day, 10k Workers AI
Neurons/day, 5M D1 rows read/day.

Measured over a day of development and testing, via the GraphQL analytics API
(`aiInferenceAdaptiveGroups` — there is no REST endpoint for this):

| Model | Role | Requests | Neurons | Per request |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5-coder-32b` | writes the SQL | 64 | 2,127.7 | **33.2** |
| `llama-3.2-3b` | describes the rows | 50 | 115.9 | **2.3** |

**~35.5 Neurons per question → roughly 280 questions/day** within the free allowance.

Two things worth reading off that table:

**The SQL model is 94% of the cost.** It runs 14× more expensive per call than the
summarizer. Switching `SQL_MODEL` to `llama-3.2-3b` would cut cost to ~4.6 Neurons/question
(~2,100/day), but SQL quality is the single biggest source of wrong answers, so the
expensive model earns its place. The lever exists if traffic ever justifies pulling it.

**64 SQL calls but only 50 prose calls.** The other 14 questions were refused as
unanswerable or returned zero rows, and short-circuited before the second inference. The
early return that fixed bug #4 also eliminated 22% of inference calls — correctness and cost
happening to point the same direction.
