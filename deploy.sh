# Deploy, then email a summary — but only if the deploy actually worked.
#
# The first version of this piped wrangler into tee and chained the notifier
# with &&. That silently reported success on a failed deploy, because the exit
# status of a pipeline is the LAST command's (tee), not wrangler's. Capturing
# the status directly is the fix.
#
# Cloudflare has no "Worker deployed" notification alert type — the only Workers
# alert is log-based observability, which fires on errors, not deployments.
# Workers Builds would provide one, but that means deploying through Cloudflare's
# CI rather than from here. Hence sending the mail ourselves.
#
# Only fires for `npm run deploy`. A bare `wrangler deploy` skips it.
