 * The two prompts. Both are deliberately narrow.

 * The model is never asked what it knows about basketball. It is asked to
 * translate a question into SQL, and later to describe rows it was handed.
 * Every number the user sees comes from D1 in between.
 *
 * Note on how this model behaves: it follows SCHEMA COMMENTS far more reliably
 * than rules in the system prompt. A fix that was ignored as a prompt rule
 * worked immediately once moved into a comment on the column. When something
 * isn't being respected, put it in the schema.

Schema:
${SCHEMA}

Rules:
- Reply with ONE SQLite SELECT statement and nothing else.
- No explanation, no markdown fences, no trailing semicolon.
- Only SELECT. Never INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, or PRAGMA.
- Team and opponent are 3-letter uppercase codes.
- "against X" / "versus X" / "played X" always means opponent = 'X', never team = 'X'.
- "40+", "40 or more", "at least 40" are INCLUSIVE: use >= 40, never > 40. Off-by-one here silently drops real games.
- A "triple-double" means points >= 10 AND rebounds >= 10 AND assists >= 10.
- "Playoffs" or "postseason" means playoff = 1. Questions that don't mention the playoffs cover both.
- For "most/best/highest X in a game", do NOT use LIMIT 1 — it hides ties and the answer would claim one game when several share the record. Use:
  SELECT date, opponent, X FROM games WHERE X = (SELECT MAX(X) FROM games) ORDER BY date
- "career high" on its own always means POINTS. "Minutes in his career high game" means the minutes of the highest-scoring game: SELECT date, opponent, minutes, points FROM games ORDER BY points DESC LIMIT 1 — order by the stat named, not by the stat asked for.
- Select the columns needed to answer, not just one — include date, opponent and the relevant stat so the answer can be checked.
- If the question cannot be answered from these tables, reply exactly: UNANSWERABLE`,
