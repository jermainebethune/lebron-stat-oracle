/**
 * SQL guard.
 *
 * The model writes SQL. This decides whether that SQL is allowed to touch the
 * database. It is an allowlist, not a blocklist: the statement must positively
 * look like a single bounded read, or it is rejected.
 *
 * Blocklists fail here. "Reject anything containing DROP" is defeated by
 * comments, casing, and string literals, and it can only ever block the
 * attacks you thought of. So the order below matters:
 *
 *   1. strip anything that can hide syntax (comments, string literals)
 *   2. assert the skeleton that remains is a single SELECT
 *   3. only then look for specific forbidden constructs
 *
 * The D1 binding should ALSO be read-only in production. This is defence in
 * depth, not the only defence.
