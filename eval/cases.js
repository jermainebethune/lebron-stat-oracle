/**
 * The answer key.
 *
 * Each case pairs a question in English with a query we wrote ourselves and
 * trust. The runner executes both and checks they agree — so we are testing
 * whether the model gets the same ANSWER, not whether it writes the same SQL.
 * There are many correct ways to phrase a query; string-matching them would
 * fail on harmless rewording and pass on subtly wrong logic.
 *
 * Expected values are never hard-coded. They come from running `truth` against
 * the live database, so reloading the dataset moves the expectations with it
 * and fixtures cannot go stale.
 *
 * Cases tagged `regression` are bugs that actually shipped. Each one is now
 * incapable of coming back silently. Do not delete them.
